/*Players generally sit in a circle. The first player says the number “1”, and each player 
says next number in turn. However, any number divisible by X (for example, three) is replaced 
by the word fizz, and any divisible by Y (for example, five) by the word buzz. Numbers divisible 
by both become fizz buzz. A player who hesitates, or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.


Write a program that prints out the final series of numbers where those divisible by X, Y 
and both are replaced by “F” for fizz, “B” for buzz and “FB” for fizz buzz.*/
